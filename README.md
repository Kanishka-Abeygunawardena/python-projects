# python-projects
A collection of Python projects and experiments for data science, KPI debugging, and AI development.

Welcome to my Python projects portfolio. I'm currently working as a Python Engineer at Trax Retail, with a focus on debugging KPIs and automating data workflows. This repository showcases my journey as I transition into data science, AI development, and ultimately toward research in nanotechnology.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through:
- Data engineering and KPI tools
- Machine learning and automation
- Long-term AI and nanotech innovations

I’m currently sharpening my skills in:
- Python programming and best practices
- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- APIs and backend logic
- Machine learning fundamentals

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each subfolder here will contain:
- 📄 Project code (`.py`, `.ipynb`)
- 📑 README for each project
- 📊 Visual outputs or screenshots (if relevant)

Example folders:
kpi-debugger/
data-cleaning-scripts/
machine-learning-basics/


## 📌 Coming Soon

- ✅ Python automation tools for KPI debugging  
- ✅ Pandas-based data transformation utilities  
- 🔜 ML model experiments (Scikit-learn, PyTorch)  
- 🔜 Projects integrating AI concepts into real-world pipelines
